Data analysis is rooted in statistics, which has a pretty long history itself. Archaeologists mark the start of statistics in ancient Egypt with the building of the pyramids. The ancient Egyptians were masters of organizing data. They documented their calculations and theories on papyri (paper-like materials), which are now viewed as the earliest examples of spreadsheets and checklists. Today’s data analysts owe a lot to those brilliant scribes, who helped create a more technical and efficient process.

It is time to enter the **data analysis** process—how industry professionals move from data to decision. All team members can drive success by planning work both upfront and at the end of the data analysis process. While the data analysis process is well known among experts, there isn't a single defined structure or single architecture that’s uniformly followed by every data analyst. But there are some shared fundamentals. This reading provides an overview of several processes.

The data analysis process is as follows.  
1. **Ask**: business challenge, objective, or question
2. **Prepare**: Prepare: data generation, collection, storage, and data management
3. **Process**: data cleaning and data integrity
4. **Analyze**: data exploration, visualization, and analysis
5. **Share**: communicating and interpreting results
6. **Act**: putting  insights to work to solve the problem
